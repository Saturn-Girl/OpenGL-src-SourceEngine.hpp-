# OpenGL-src-SourceEngine.hpp-

## 🌌 About This Project

This is an **OpenGL-based recreation of the Source Engine**, built completely from scratch. I made this game engine because I couldn't download the original Source Engine from Valve, so I decided to create my own version using OpenGL.

This engine powers my game **YandereSourceEngine.exe**, which is proprietary and distributed on CD and [itch.io](https://saturn-computing-topic.itch.io/).

> 🔒 While this engine's code is open source for learning purposes, it is not free for reuse in other projects. Please read the license below.
